WORK IN PROGRESS.

Small, safe and fast parsing library.

Idea based on [fmtlib](http://fmtlib.net), but for parsing, i.e. a type-safe alternative for scanf.

Goals:
* Faster than scanf
* Limit memory allocations
* Use compile-time information where possible
* Benchmark against scanf and Boost.Spirit.Karma.
